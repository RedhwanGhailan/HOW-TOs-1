LLVM executables are installed in /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin.
Extra tools are installed in /usr/local/opt/llvm/share/llvm.

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Mac OS X already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include


If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/llvm.pth
  mkdir -p /Users/marco/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /Users/marco/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth
